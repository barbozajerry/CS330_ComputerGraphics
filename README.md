<h4>How do I approach designing software?</h4>
I was able to apply the resources given to me to create clean code and following all the steps to a good OpenGL coding project. 

<h4>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?<h4>
 I learned a lot in this course that helped me develop my design skills in Computer Graphics. Some of these skills include: working with camera and positioning in the right place for a better composition/view, working with textures, shaders and light. 
  
 <h4>What design process did you follow for your project work?</h4>
  I followed the recourses our professor gave us and examples that gave me a better undertanding to a great design process. 
  
  <h4>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?</h4>
  My tactics from my design approach can be applied in the future when working with OpenGL since I plan to develop more 3D Scence using OpenGL and C++ as a hobby while I become better at it. 
  
  <h4>How do I approach developing programs?</h4>
  OpenGL is a great tool for computer graphics using C++ as the main programming language since it is a powerful programming language used in video games, animations and other things that needs to be fast with large amount of memory. 
  <h4>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?</h4>
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  <h4>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?</h4> 
  Computer Science is a great skill to have for anyone in any field since it can be applied to almost any field, from the video game industry and animation studios like Pixar, to the medical world developing MRI and other technologies that is helping save lives.
<h4>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?</h4> 
  Computational Graphics and Visualization gives me the knowledge and skills to succeed in graduate school once I attend gradute school since I will continue working with C++ and Computer Graphics with A.I.. 
<h4>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?</h4>
  Computer Graphics and Visualization gives me the knowledge and skills I need for my futire professional pathway since my goal is to work as a Sumulation and Modeling Engineer after going for graduate school and improving my computer graphics.
